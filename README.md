# NewUntis
This project is a PHP-Libary for the WebUntis-API.

[WebUntis](http://www.grupet.at/HTML/produkteUntis.php?p=webuntis) is a School-Timetable-System developed by Gruber & Petters. The official api documentation is located [here](https://api.webuntis.dk/api/).

##Getting Started
The project is developed for PHP 7.0, but I'm pretty sure it should work with PHP 5.4, too. (Not tested yet).

###Prerequisites
Curl for PHP is required.
